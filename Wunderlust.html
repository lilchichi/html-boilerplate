    <ul>
      <li>S.East Asia</li> 
      <li>South America</li>
      <li>
        Africa; Yes I do mean the continent & most countries in there (as long
        as they're not in massive conflict & it's relatively safe to travel
        there)
      </li>
      <li>
        Middle East (If only I could time travel to before a lot of those
        countries were plunged into war)
      </li>
      <li>
        New Zealand ... I'd love to do the Hobbit Trail as I'm a LOTR fan (I
        haven't read the books yet)
      </li>
